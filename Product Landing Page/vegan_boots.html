					<h2>Stella McCartney Velvet Boots</h2>
					<p class="text">Stella McCartney’s boots are made in Italy from  faux suede, leather and velvet, her boots are known for their chunky, easy to walk in heels.  Designed to hit high on the ankle, they’re also perfect for tucking your skinny jeans into. Her velvet ankle boots with their curved, claw-like heel, are bound to be one of the most coveted – and copied – boots of the season.</p>

					<h2>Free People Cowboy Ankle Boots</h2>
					<p class="text">The Cavalier Boot by Free People looks like the leathery Western classic, but guess what? These are vegan! We love the fancy cut out detailing, and the heel is just the right height. What’s a better style companion for a great pair of jeans?</p>

					<h2>Beyond Skin</h2>
					<p class="text">There are so many great boots from this brand this season, we don’t know where to start: from faux sheepskin, vegan suede, vegan leathers and fake furs, there are plenty of textures to choose from. But we’re thinking if you live in a place that may get icy, the soles on these chic booties may just save your butt – literally!</p>

					<h2>NAE Vegan Saka Boots</h2>
					<p class="text">We’re totally crushing on fall boots by vegan-and-proud brand NAE vegan. This brand has some quite arty touches, such as the embroidery on their best-selling Saka boots. We love the contrast between the tough style of the motorcycle boot, and the tender, flowery embroidery.</p>

					<h2>NOAH Geometric Ankle Boot</h2>
					<p class="text">The team at Noah have perfected the art in making simple, utterly beautiful! The boot styles are super-elegant  and enhance any fall wardrobe perfectly. Only 100% vegan materials are used in the creation of these exquisite, Italian handcrafted Dora ankle boots, below.</p>

					<h2>Lookie Lou Wood Heeled Knee High Boot</h2>
					<p class="text">Lookie here! We just discovered this brand. It’s not necessarily eco-friendly, but they do have a good range of vegan leather boots for those who are more focused on the cruelty-free element of vegan leather, as opposed to the potentially sustainable one. We do love that the heels are made from upcycled wood, though.</p>

					<h2>Olsen Haus Wedges</h2>
					<p class="text">Possibly America’s top vegan brand, Olsen Haus offers a broad collection of boots this season for vegans and fashionistas alike. We’d love to wear these faux suede, wood wedge numbers with a pair of jeans…maybe just not in the snow and ice, of course.</p>

					<h2>Pimkie Chelsea Boots</h2>
					<p class="text">The Chelsea boot is back! And this season, no one’s doing it better than French label Pimkie. With  a nod to the catwalks, their casual footwear collections are made of leather-free textiles that last and last.</p>

					<h2>ASOS Heeled Sock Boots</h2>
					<p class="text">Sock boots are officially a ‘thing’ and hallelujah to that! Easy to slip on, comfy as heck, and in the case of these reasonably priced babies from ASOS, cruelty-free, too.</p>
				</div>

					<h2>Stella McCartney Leopard Print Stiletto Boots</h2>
					<p class="text">Channel your inner rock chick with these sassy boots! They may carry a leopard print (which is dead on trend this season) but they’re as far from actual animal products as you can get.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="product">
					<div class="images" id="img11"> 
					</div>
					<h2>Raid Stretch Sock Boot</h2>
					<p class="text">Another key trend? RED! We’re talking cherry red here; the kind of red you see in crayon boxes, not that deep, dark burgundy stuff. And these boots slay two trends in one: red + sock boot! Pair them with a sky blue midi skirt, and you’re basically killing all the winter fashion trends.</p>

					<h2>NAE Vegan Chere Boot</h2>
					<p class="text">We HAD to put this style here – after all, these boots were named after Eluxe’s founder! Why? Because she loves herself a great, vegan, knee-high boot is why. And in fact, she helped design them: there’s a chunky heel that’s comfy and easy to walk in, but just high enough to be sexy. Chere also designed a bit of space at the top of the boot to allow you to tuck jeans into them…or not!</p>
