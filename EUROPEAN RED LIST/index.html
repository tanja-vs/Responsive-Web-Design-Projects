			<p><span>The European Red List</span> is a review of the status of European species according to IUCN regional Red Listing guidelines. It identifies those species that are threatened with extinction at the European level (Pan-Europe and the European Union) so that appropriate conservation action can be taken to improve their status.</p>
			<p>Funded by the European Commission since 2006, <span>the European Red List</span> is compiled by IUCN’s Global Species Programme in collaboration with the Species Survival Commission and other partners and experts. To date 10,810 species have been assessed on <span>the European Red List</span> including all vertebrate species (mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds and fishes), freshwater molluscs, medicinal plants, dragonflies, butterflies, bees, grasshopper, crickets, bush-crickets, and a selection of terrestrial molluscs, saproxylic beetles and plants.</p>

			<h3>Saiga antelope</h3>
			<p>The saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is a critically endangered antelope that originally inhabited a vast area of the Eurasian steppe zone from the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and Caucasus into Dzungaria and Mongolia.</p>
			<p>Today, the dominant subspecies (S. t. tatarica) is only found in one location in Russia (in the Republic of Kalmykia) and three areas in Kazakhstan (the Ural, Ustiurt, and Betpak-Dala populations).</p>

			<h3>Iberian lynx</h3>
			<p>The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild cat species native to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe that is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It preys almost exclusively on the European rabbit. In the 20th century, the Iberian lynx population declined because of sharp declines in rabbit populations, caused by myxomatosis, rabbit haemorrhagic disease and overhunting, fragmentation of grassland and forest habitats and poaching.</p>

			<h3>Mediterranean monk seal</h3>
			<p>The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) is a monk seal belonging to the family Phocidae. As of 2015, it is estimated that fewer than 700 individuals survive in three or four isolated subpopulations in the Mediterranean, (especially) in the Aegean Sea, the archipelago of Madeira and the Cabo Blanco area in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It is believed to be the world's rarest pinniped species.</p>

			<h3>North Atlantic right whale</h3>
			<p>The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is a baleen whale, one of three right whale species belonging to the genus Eubalaena, all of which were formerly classified as a single species. Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produced high yields of whale oil), right whales were once a preferred target for whalers. At present, they are among the most endangered whales in the world.</p>

			<h3>Bavarian pine vole</h3>
			<p>The Bavarian pine vole (Microtus bavaricus) is a vole from the Austrian, Italian, and Bavarian Alps of Europe. It lives in moist meadows at elevations of 600 to 1,000 meters. This rodent was previously known to live in only one location, Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, which was altered by the construction of a hospital in the 1980s. No specimens of this rodent were recorded after 1962 and it was thought to be extinct. However, a population apparently belonging to this species was discovered in 2000 in Northern Tyrol, just across the German-Austrian border.</p>

			<p>Nearly one in six (15%) of <span>Europe</span>’s 2313 <span>mammal species</span> are threatened, and a further 9% are close to qualifying for threatened status. <cite>"Habitat loss and degradation is the greatest threat to terrestrial mammals in Europe, while the main issue for marine mammals are accidental mortality (e.g., fisheries bycatch), pollution, and overexploitation"</cite>, according to the report.</p>
